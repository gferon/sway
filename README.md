"**S**irCmpwn's **Way**land compositor" is a **work in progress**
i3-compatible [Wayland](http://wayland.freedesktop.org/) compositor.

[IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sway&uio=d4) (#sway on
irc.freenode.net).

**Notice**: Sway is currently *frozen* and no new features are being shipped
until we finish integrating Sway and  wlroots. Bug fixes are still going out.
for more information, [see this
article](https://drewdevault.com/2017/10/09/Future-of-sway.html). To follow
wlroots integration status, [see this
ticket](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/1390).

## Installation

### From Packages

Sway is available in many distributions. Try installing the "sway" package for
yours. If it's not available, check out [this wiki page](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/Unsupported-packages)
for information on installation for your distributions.

If you're interested in packaging Sway for your distribution, stop by the IRC
channel or shoot an email to sir@cmpwn.com for advice.

### Compiling from Source

Install dependencies:

* cmake
* [wlc](https://github.com/Cloudef/wlc)
* wayland
* xwayland
* libinput >= 1.6.0
* libcap
* asciidoc
* pcre
* json-c <= 0.12.1
* pango
* cairo
* gdk-pixbuf2 *
* pam **
* imagemagick (required for image capture with swaygrab)
* ffmpeg (required for video capture with swaygrab)

_\*Only required for swaybar, swaybg, and swaylock_

_\*\*Only required for swaylock_

Run these commands:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR=/etc ..
    make
    sudo make install

On systems with logind, you need to set a few caps on the binary:

    sudo setcap "cap_sys_ptrace,cap_sys_tty_config=eip" /usr/local/bin/sway

On systems without logind, you need to suid the sway binary:

    sudo chmod a+s /usr/local/bin/sway

## Configuration

If you already use i3, then copy your i3 config to `~/.config/sway/config` and
it'll work out of the box. Otherwise, copy the sample configuration file to
`~/.config/sway/config`. It is usually located at `/etc/sway/config`.
Run `man 5 sway` for information on the configuration.

## Running

Run `sway` from a TTY. Some display managers may work but are not supported by
Sway (gdm is known to work fairly well).
